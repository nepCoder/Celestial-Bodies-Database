## Description

## Getting Started
1. Pull repository or download ***universe.sql*** file.
2. Log in to ***PostgreSQL*** with psql. Do that by entering ```psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres``` in the terminal.  
3. Rebuild the database by entering ```psql -U postgres < universe.sql``` in a terminal where the .sql file is.
4.  You can make a dump of your database by entering  ```pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp universe > universe.sql``` in a bash terminal (not the psql one).
